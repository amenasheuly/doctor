  <p style="text-align: center;  font-size: 20px;" >An electronic health record (EHR), or electronic medical record (EMR), 
is the systematized collection of patient and population electronically-stored health information in a digital format.
These records can be shared across different health care settings. Records are shared through network-connected, 
enterprise-wide information systems or other information networks and exchanges. EHRs may include a range of data, 
including demographics, medical history, medication and allergies, immunization status, laboratory test results,
 radiology images, vital signs, personal statistics like age and weight, and billing information.</p>

 <h3><b>Background</b></h3>
 <hr>
 <p>
The business was founded with a strong will to solve a real problem that impacts many in the country. The thought was kindled by the observation that people living in places beyond the major cities face  tremendous troubles in finding a right doctor at the right time and subsequently suffer in securing treatment when they need it. Bangladesh is making significant progresses in many areas. Information technology, without any doubt has been instrumental in the transformation of people's way of doing  things. We have seen bus, train or launch tickets being bought online. Online freelancing bringing  new skills, confidence and earnings to thousands of youths. Noticeable boost in the e-commerce. Use of mobile money making lives better. Ironically, despite of being one of the most essential services, healthcare has not been focused with similar initiatives yet. There are still roadblocks  disrupting smooth healthcare delivery even today. And, information technology has rarely been called up to effectively contribute in the sector.</p>

<h3><b>Evolution into a Service Platform</b></h3>
<b><hr></b>
<p>The idea of Doctorola evolved into a service platform in early 2014. It was not what it is today in the initial days. It started as a doctor's directory along with a feature for appointment  requests. After realizing that only accomplishing appointment bookings will not help much,  the whole vision was revisited. We needed to offer more. We needed to build and maintain  relationships with the patients and doctors to ensure smoother connection for the service.  We needed to add new features and extend the whole platform to accommodate many things that people  will never see working as the back office. Doctorola understands the individuality of each patient  and their problem. The platform is capable of maintaining records of queries, appointments, visits  and visit outcomes. With the aid of a huge knowledge base built and maintained within the platform, Doctorola can follow up and take extended care of their users for their unique problems. Further, for ensuring real time availability of the doctors at their chambers, a dedicated team constantly engages with the hospitals, clinics and chambers' management.</p>
